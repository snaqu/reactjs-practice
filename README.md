## Mastering React :yellow_heart:

It's folder with files to learn reactjs and improvement more skills. Every single project have simple css, so files are for improve my *reactjs* skills not css.

+ In **component-state-props** folder every single javascript file is individual mini project. If you want to see live, change source in index.html.
+ **mini-checkout** - files in it are one project.
+ **forms** - single projects.
+ **exchange** - single projects.
